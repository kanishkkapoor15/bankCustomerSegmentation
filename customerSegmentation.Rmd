Objective

Your goal for bank customer segmentation should be to group customers based on their financial behavior, demographic characteristics, and credit risk profiles. This can help in:
	1.	Understanding Customer Profiles – Identifying different types of customers based on age, savings, credit usage, and loan purposes.
	2.	Personalized Marketing & Services – Offering targeted banking products based on customer segments.
	3.	Credit Risk Analysis – Identifying high-risk vs. low-risk customer groups.
	4.	Optimizing Loan Offerings – Helping the bank refine loan approval strategies.


##Libraries
```{r}
library("ggplot2")
library("caret")
library("dplyr")
library("cluster")
library("factoextra")
```


## Load dataset

```{r}
customer <- read.csv("german_credit_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(customer)
str(customer)
```
## Data cleaning
```{r}
colSums(is.na(customer))
```
```{r}
customer$Saving.accounts[is.na(customer$Saving.accounts)] <- "Unknown"

customer$Checking.account[is.na(customer$Checking.account)] <- "Unknown"
```

```{r}
colSums(is.na(customer))
```
In Step 2, we convert categorical variables into numerical form using One-Hot Encoding (OHE) because clustering algorithms (like K-Means) work with numerical data only.

Why is this necessary?
	•	Machine learning models can’t directly handle categorical data (like “male”/“female” or “own”/“free”/“rent”).
	•	Distance-based algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) require numeric inputs to calculate distances between data points.
	
```{r}
#converting categorical variables

customer$Sex <- as.factor(customer$Sex)

customer$Housing <- as.factor(customer$Housing)

customer$Saving.accounts <- as.factor(customer$Saving.accounts)

customer$Checking.account <- as.factor(customer$Checking.account)

customer$Purpose <- as.factor(customer$Purpose)

```

```{r}
customer_encoded <- model.matrix(~ Sex + Housing + Saving.accounts + Checking.account + Purpose -1, data = customer)
```

```{r}
customer_final <- cbind(customer[, c("Age","Job", "Credit.amount", "Duration")], customer_encoded)
```

```{r}
head(customer_final)
```


```{r}
customer_scaled <- scale(customer_final)

```
Before applying K-Means, we need to choose the number of clusters (k).
Too few clusters → Loss of information.
Too many clusters → Overfitting and hard to interpret.

💡 Elbow Method Concept
	•	K-Means tries to minimize the “within-cluster sum of squares” (WCSS), which measures how close data points are within a cluster.
	•	As k increases, WCSS decreases (clusters are smaller and more compact).
	•	However, after a certain k, the WCSS decrease slows down.
	•	The “Elbow Point” is where adding more clusters does not significantly reduce WCSS anymore.
### Finding Clusters for K- mean Clustering
```{r}
fviz_nbclust(customer_scaled, kmeans, method = "wss")
```
	•	The plot shows WCSS vs. k.
	•	The elbow point (where the curve bends) suggests the best k.
		•	The y-axis represents the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) (how close data points are within a cluster).
	•	The x-axis represents the number of clusters (k).
	•	The goal is to find the “elbow point”, where WCSS stops decreasing significantly.

What is the Optimal k?
	•	The sharpest drop is between k = 1 to k = 3.
	•	After k = 3, the WCSS keeps decreasing but at a slower rate.
	•	The “elbow” seems to be around k = 3 or k = 4.
	
### K- Means Clustering Method

```{r}
set.seed(123)
kmeans_result <- kmeans(customer_scaled, centers = 3, nstart=25)

customer$Cluster <- as.factor(kmeans_result$cluster)

```
```{r}

fviz_cluster(kmeans_result, data=customer_scaled)
```

### Cluster Profiling
```{r}
 customer %>%
  group_by(Cluster) %>%
  summarise(Age = mean(Age),
            Credit = mean(Credit.amount),
            Duration = mean(Duration),
            Job = mean(Job),
            Count = n())
```
Interpretation
	•	Cluster 1 (Low-Risk Borrowers) → Largest group (538 customers), moderate age, low credit amounts, and short durations. Likely stable individuals with controlled borrowing.
	•	Cluster 2 (High-Credit Customers) → Smallest group (169 customers), highest credit amount (~7729), and longest loan duration (~37 months). These customers could be high-income individuals or businesses.
	•	Cluster 3 (Young Borrowers) → Younger customers (~32.5 years old), smaller loans, short durations. Likely early-career individuals taking short-term loans.


### Visualizations

```{r}
ggplot(customer, aes(x= Cluster, fill = Cluster)) +
  geom_bar() +
  ggtitle("Customer Distribution Across Clusters") +
  xlab("Cluster") + ylab("Number of Customers") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
ggplot(customer, aes(x= Age, y= Credit.amount, color = Cluster)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.6) +
  ggtitle("Age vs Credit Amount") +
  xlab("Age") + ylab("Credit Amount") +
  theme_minimal()
```
